I am finishing my first ever semester of a coding class and have enjoyed it (For the most part, maybe not Files as much). Anyways, I can't wait to see what happens next and how this will affect my career,because I am on the Cyber Security side of things and was not expecting to have to take this, after taking it I completely understand why its important to Security.
